  <h1>Logo</h1>
  <p> Knoll is a constellation of design-driven brands and people, working together with our clients to create inspired modern interiors.
    <br>This logo is mainly focused on capturing the vibe of an ergonomic and research related facility. The light represents the innovations that are made within the Knoll Library. The bottom part of the house shape is meant to represent a work desk where people sit to do their research. 
    The modern feel of the logo is inspired by a quote from Knoll which states that “Knoll is modern always because modern always works”.
